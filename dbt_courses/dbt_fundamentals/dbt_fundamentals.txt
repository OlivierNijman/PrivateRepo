# who is analytics engineer
trad teams: 
engineers (etl, orchestration, python/java) and analysts (dashboard, reporting, excel/sql)

## etl and elt 
etl: download data, transform data, load data 
required additional tools, languages, skills
enter cloud based data warehouses (combine database and supercomputer for transforming data)
data can be transformed directly in database, no need to extract and load repeatedly

now elt: extract load transform
get data in warehouse and then transform as needed
scalable compute and storage + reduction of transfer time

## Analytics engineer
owns the transformation of raw data up to the BI layer
frees up engineer for loading raw data and data infrastructure
analysts work on delivering dashboards and reporting to stakeholders

## The modern data stack and dbt
data sources -> loaders -> data platforms (snwflk) also where dbt is -> bi tools/ml models/operational analytics 
raw data -> develop -> test & document -> deploy -> datasets

## overview of an exemplar project
DAG = directed acyclic graph
sources/loaders (green) -> models (dbt, blue) -> dataset (dim/fact/flat, purple)
dbt run/test/build/docs generate are important commands
source and ref macro/function to refer to the data you build off (yml = yaml)
tests go in .yml file as well as documentation
can run on a schedule with jobs - deployment

# Set up dbt Cloud
dbt Cloud = hosted version that streamlines development with an online IDE and interface to run dbt on a schedule.
dbt Core = command line tool that can be run locally.
demos use snowflake and git
dbt is going to be the transformation interface between the code we write (stored/managed in a git repo) 
    and the sample data we have to work with (stored and transformed in your data platform (snwflk)).

dbt models/tests/sources/schema (.yml and sql files) and snowflake warehouses/database/schema
also for setting op developer and deployment jobs etc.
