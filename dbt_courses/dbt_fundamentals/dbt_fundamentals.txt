# who is analytics engineer
trad teams: 
engineers (etl, orchestration, python/java) and analysts (dashboard, reporting, excel/sql)

# etl and elt 
etl: download data, transform data, load data 
required additional tools, languages, skills
enter cloud based data warehouses (combine database and supercomputer for transforming data)
data can be transformed directly in database, no need to extract and load repeatedly

now elt: extract load transform
get data in warehouse and then transform as needed
scalable compute and storage + reduction of transfer time

# Analytics engineer
owns the transformation of raw data up to the BI layer
frees up engineer for loading raw data and data infrastructure
analysts work on delivering dashboards and reporting to stakeholders

# The modern data stack and dbt
data sources -> loaders -> data platforms (snwflk) also where dbt is -> bi tools/ml models/operational analytics 
raw data -> develop -> test & document -> deploy -> datasets

# overview of an exemplar project
DAG = directed acyclic graph
sources/loaders (green) -> models (dbt, blue) -> dataset (dim/fact/flat, purple)
dbt run - builds up the dataset from left to right
source and ref macro/function to refer to the data you build off (yml = yaml)
tests go in .yml file as well as documentation
dbt test - test the builded models
dbt build - run and test models
dbt docs generate - builds up the document side
can run on a schedule with jobs - deployment
