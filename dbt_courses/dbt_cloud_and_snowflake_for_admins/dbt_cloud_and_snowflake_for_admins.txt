configure github for dbt cloud
create new org repo in github (org/dbt-project) for example

in dbt, the site will guide you through all the steps to connect to github and snowflake. 
check in the end if everything is integrated properly by putting in some dbt run/build commands 

# setting up environments, jobs and folders
Usefull to have a production environment next to dev.
should be set up to a service user account, not personal.

deploy -> environments
development will be there already, create a production 
deployment connection should not be the same for production as for development connection.

then can make jobs, that run you dbt project on a schedule

set up folders by data maturity
staging folder - simple transformation to clean data (stg)
mart folder - key business logic (dim/fact)

set up folders by domain
set up folder for different departments (e.g. finance, marketing, sales)

configure the dbt_project.yml and readme.md file to represent your work.
