# Jinja 
python based templating language, brings functional aspects to sql
enables better collaboration / writing sql faster with less lines / sets foundation for macros

can use it like python (set variables/lists/dictionaries etc.) -> 0 indexing!

2 basic forms of jinja syntax
{%  %}   {%  %} - operation is happening inside jinja context
{{  }} - pulling something out of jinja context, printing into file in order to produce written material
{#  #} - comment out in jinja
{%-  -%} - use the minus signs so the jinja doesn't generate whitespace for that line
examples:

{% for i in range(10) %}
    select {{ i }} as number {% if not loop.last %} union all {% endif %}
{% endfor %}


{%- set foods = ['carrot', 'hotdog', 'cucumber', 'bell_pepper'] -%}

{%- for food in foods -%}
    {%- if food == 'hotdog' -%}
        {%- set food_type = 'snack' -%}
    {%- else -%}
        {%- set food_type = 'vegetable' -%}
    {%- endif -%}
    
    the humble {{ food }} is my favorite {{ food_type }}

{% endfor %}

A few helpful features of Jinja include dictionaries, lists, if/else statements, for loops, and macros.
- Dictionaries are data structures composed of key-value pairs
- Lists are data structures that are ordered and indexed by integers
- If/else statements are control statements to provide instructions based on clear criteria
- For loops make it possible to repeat a code block while passing different values for each iteration
- Macros = writing functions in Jinja. This allows us to write a set of statements once and then reference those statements throughout your code base


# Macros
write generic logic one, re-use that logic throughout your project, increase development speed
we can use the macros that others wrote in our own workflow
packages allow you to import macros other developers wrote into your own project
important to consider readability, is using a macro necessary? 
DRY code (don't repeat yourself) vs. readable code

can use macros to limit data loaded in dev
{% if target.name = 'dev' %}
    where collector_tstamp >= dateadd('day', -3, current_timestamp)
{% endif %}
to 
{% macro limit_data_in_dev(column_name, cutoff = -3) %}
    {% if target.name == 'dev' %}
        where {{ column_name }} >= dateadd('day', {{ cutoff }}, current_timestamp)
    {% endif %}
{% endmacro %}
